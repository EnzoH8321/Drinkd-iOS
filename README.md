# DRINKD
App that lets you and your friend's plan for a night out. 

## Why?
The hardest part about going for a night out with your friends is deciding where to go. Everyone has their own opinions, no one can decide on anything. With this app, you create a party, invite your friends and vote on which bar or restaurant you would like to go to. Highest vote wins. No arguing or complaining. 

## Latest News
Version 2.0 is almost here! 1.0 released way back in 2021, almost a lifetime ago in the iOS world. With 2.0, the app received almost a complete revamp in terms of the UI and backend, Firebase has been removed in favor of a combination of Supabase/ custom Vapor server.
